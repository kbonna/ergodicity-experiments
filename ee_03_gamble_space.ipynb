    "## Constructing gamble space\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's introduce the geometric representation of the space of all possible gambles. First, we define $N_{\\text{fractals}}$ isoelastic wealth changes for wealth dynamic given by $\\eta$, and growth rates equally spaced within the range $[-c, c]$. We want $N_{\\text{fractals}}$ to be an odd integer – in that case, the \"middle\" wealth change corresponds to null wealth change with zero growth rate. These wealth changes would correspond to a set of stimuli for our experiment. In the Copenhagen experiment fractal images were used as stimuli, and $N_{\\text{fractals}}=9$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now draw these gambles in a 2D space as points on a grid. Any gamble can be represented as a pair $(\\gamma_1, \\gamma_2)$ which geometrically correspond to a point in $\\mathbb{R}$. In the gamble space, X-axis corresponds to the growth rate of the first fractal, and Y-axis corresponds to the second fractal's growth rate. The $(0, 0)$ point is in the middle of the gamble space and represents the null gamble. Note that we are interested in unordered pairs of stimuli – because, with equal probabilities for both wealth changes within a gamble, the order does not matter. This allows us to draw only half of the space, the \"lower triangle\" cut from the full space. The total number of gambles given $N_{\\text{fractals}}$ wealth changes is $N_{\\text{gambles}}=\\binom{N_{\\text{fractals}}}{2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Different regions of the gamble space correspond to different types of gambles. Red gambles are losing gambles (both wealth changes have negative growth rate), green gambles are winning gambles (both wealth changes have a positive growth rate), yellow gambles are mixed (one wealth change has a positive growth rate and the other has negative growth rate).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note that in the visual representation of gamble space used throughout these notebooks, Y-axis *is reversed*, i.e., negative growth rates are located in the upper part of the space. \n",
    "\n",
    "How can we represent possible trials using gamble space? Single experimental trial is a pair of gambles and can be represented by four numbers $(\\gamma^{\\text{left}}_1, \\gamma^{\\text{left}}_2, \\gamma^{\\text{right}}_1, \\gamma^{\\text{right}}_2)$. From the geometrical perspective, a gamble pair is just a pair of gambles represented as points. Therefore we can visualize it as **an edge** (or a line) between two points (gambles). Again, the order of gambles within a gamble pair is irrelevant – an agent should choose a better gamble regardless of its position on the screen. The total number of unique gamble pairs depend on the total number of available gambles and its given as $N_{\\text{gamble pairs}}=\\binom{N_{\\text{gambles}}}{2}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Gamble pairs consisting of a single gamble repeated twice are excluded from our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Directions in gamble space\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, after we constructed gamble space and gamble pair space, let's gather more geometrical intuition about that space. Besides X-axis and Y-axis, let's define two additional axes: **variance axis** and **average growth rate axis**. The direction of these axes is reflected by the two diagonal lines in gamble space. \n",
    "\n",
    "First diagonal line (corresponding to the function $\\gamma_1=-\\gamma_2$) reflect the variance axis. Variance is simply defined as the difference in growth rates:\n",
    "$$var(\\gamma_1, \\gamma_2)=|\\gamma_1-\\gamma_2|.$$\n",
    "The perpendicular projection of a gamble (point) onto that axis reflects the gamble's variance. For example, all gambles for which $\\gamma_1=\\gamma_2$ project onto 0 on variance axis, i.e., their variance is 0. These gambles are called *deterministic gambles* because their outcome is sure. The gamble with the highest variance is the gamble on the lower left corner of the gamble space. For that gamble, $\\gamma_1=-\\gamma_2$, so $var(\\gamma_1, \\gamma_2)=2\\gamma_1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second diagonal line (corresponding to the function $\\gamma_1=\\gamma_2$) reflects the average growth rate axis. This axis is parallel to the hypothenuse of the \"gamble space triangle.\" The average growth rate of a gamble is:\n",
    "$$\\overline{\\gamma}=\\frac{\\gamma_1 +\\gamma_2}{2}.$$\n",
    "The perpendicular projection onto that axis reflects the gamble's expected growth rate. For example, all gambles for which $\\gamma_1=-\\gamma_2$ have $\\overline{\\gamma}=0$. For these gambles, expected wealth is equal to initial wealth. The gamble on the top left corner is the worst possible gamble with $\\overline{\\gamma}=-c$, whereas the gamble on the bottom right corner is the best possible gamble with $\\overline{\\gamma}=c$. The maximum possible distance along the average growth rate axis is the distance between $\\overline{\\gamma}$ for the best and the worst gambles, and its equal to $max(\\Delta \\gamma)=2c$. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Constraining gamble space\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple ways to constrain gamble space and gamble pair space. We will introduce these constraints based on variance and average growth rate axes. We can use each axis to define four constraints: two acting on gamble space (restricting possible gambles) and two acting on gamble pair space (restricting possible gamble pairs). \n",
    "\n",
    "| parameter | symbol | description |\n",
    "|---|---|---|\n",
    "| min variance | $$var_{\\text{min}}$$  | exclude gambles with lowest variance |\n",
    "| max variance | $$var_{\\text{max}}$$  | exclude gambles with highest variance |\n",
    "| min variance distance  | $$\\Delta var_{\\text{min}}$$  | exclude gamble pairs with low difference in variance  |\n",
    "| max variance distance  | $$\\Delta var_{\\text{max}}$$  | exclude gamble pairs with high difference in variance  |\n",
    "| min growth rate | $$\\gamma_{\\text{min}}$$  | exclude gambles with lowest avg. growth rate |\n",
    "| max growth rate | $$\\gamma_{\\text{max}}$$  | exclude gambles with highest avg. growth rate |\n",
    "| min growth rate distance  | $$\\Delta \\gamma_{\\text{min}}$$  | exclude gamble pairs with low difference in avg. growth rate  |\n",
    "| max growth rate distance  | $$\\Delta \\gamma_{\\text{max}}$$  | exclude gamble pairs with high difference in avg. growth rate  |\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explain how these constraints affect available gambles and gamble pairs. First we define two gambles $g_a=(\\gamma^a_1, \\gamma^a_2)$, and $g_b=(\\gamma^b_1, \\gamma^b_2)$. Now we can ask the question if the gamble pair composed of $g_a$ and $g_b$ will be admitted or removed, given imposed constraints. For example, in case of min variance, the gamble pair $(g_a, g_b)$ would be excluded if either $|\\gamma^a_1 -\\gamma^a_2|<var_{\\text{min}}$, or $|\\gamma^b_1 -\\gamma^b_2|<var_{\\text{min}}$. Let's consider another example of min growth rate distance. This parameter operates of both gambles from the pair; $(g_a, g_b)$ would be excluded if $|\\overline{\\gamma^a}-\\overline{\\gamma^b}|<\\Delta \\gamma_{\\text{min}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We would not use all of these constraints in subsequent analysis. Using them all would allow a large space of possible experimental designs to evaluate and significantly increase computation time. We've decided to include only five of them:\n",
    "- $var_{\\text{min}}$\n",
    "- $var_{\\text{max}}$\n",
    "- $\\gamma_{\\text{min}}$\n",
    "- $\\gamma_{\\text{max}}$\n",
    "- $\\Delta \\gamma_{\\text{max}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note that there is some redundancy in the parameter space. This means that we can find different parameter values leading to the same subset of available gamble pairs. For example, for any $\\gamma_{\\text{min}}$ and $\\gamma_{\\text{max}}$ such that $\\gamma_{\\text{max}}$<$\\gamma_{\\text{min}}$ the set of gamble pairs is empty. Therefore, it's unnecessary to exhaustively evaluate all parameter values – by finding and excluding redundancy, we can significantly decrease the number of performed simulations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The last parameter (constraint) that we included is a boolean flag (`include_nobrainers`) controlling the inclusion of no-brainer gamble pairs. The no-brainer gamble pair (or trial) is a trial in which the same wealth change is present in both the left and right gamble. These are called no-brainers because all agents should choose a gamble with a higher growth rate of the unique wealth change regardless of their risk preference. From the geometrical perspective, no-brainers are all edges that are vertical or horizontal.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Growth rate scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "One crucial parameter controlling gamble space but not directly influencing the set of available trials is the growth rate scaling parameter $c$. This parameter controls the growth rates of all wealth changes equally distributed within the range $[-c, c]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In general, changing $c$ interacts with variance and growth rate bounds. However, if we define these bounds relative to $c$, they become independent. For example, we can set $var_{\\text{min}}=\\frac{c}{5}$. This way, by changing $c$, the subset of available gamble pairs remains unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interactive gamble space plot\n",
    "\n",
    "Below you can play around with constraining gamble space using an interactive gamble space plot. By moving different sliders, you can change parameters controlling variance and the average growth rate of gambles and gamble pairs. Inset plot show final wealth distribution for three dynamic and time-optimal agent facing an experiment created out of constrained gamble pair space. The mini-simulation running in the background assumes that the agent is deterministic and plays for 180 total trials. \n",
    "\n",
    "The table below inset plot shows a number of different types of gamble pairs available for a particular setting. \"$+$\" denotes win-only gambles for which both growth rates are greater or equal to zero, \"$-$\" denotes loose-only gambles with both growth rates less or equal to zero, and \"$\\pm$\" denotes mixed gambles for which one gamble is winning and the other is loosing, i.e., $\\gamma_1\\gamma_2<0$. Table values indicate the number of edges (gamble pairs) linking two gambles of a specific type. For example, the cell value on the intersection of the \"$+$\" column and \"$\\pm$\" row indicate the number of possible trials in which one gamble is win-only, and the other is mixed. The total number of available gambles and gamble pairs (and percentage of the total number of gambles/gamble pairs for the entire space) is denoted as $\\#ga$, and $\\#gp$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Three additional sliders control growth rate scaling in risk-seeking dynamic ($c_{\\text{rse}}$), additive dynamic ($c_{\\text{lin}}$), and multiplicative dynamic ($c_{\\text{log}}$). These sliders only influence final wealth distribution represented on the inset plot."
