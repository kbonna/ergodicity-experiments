This directiory contains core functions and helpers for generating ergodicity experiment simulations. 

Modules:
- `models`: object-oriented code for simulations
- `parallel`: vectorized code for parallel simulations (same functionality as in `models` but allows for much faster computation)
- `plotting`: visualization functions
- `style`: matplotlib helpers
